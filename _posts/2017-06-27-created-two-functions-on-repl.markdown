title: Created Two Functions On Repl in Python!

Hi Everyone!

I've been working hard to learn more in Python today. 
I created two new functions/programs on REPL that you can check out below.
I am just now learning about functions in the Python programming language, so these are pretty basic.

The first function program I created is very simple and simply prints out two successful statements when run, if the if conditional statments are true. 
You can check that out at <a href="https://repl.it/JETz/1">defining true control functions test</a>.

The second function program I created is still pretty plain but it is much different than the first program in the fact that it supports arguments/argumentation.
When printing the function, you input any number for the argument and the function tells you if that number is greater or less or equal to the number 10. I think it's cool.
And it is work's 100% of the time.
You can take a look at that at <a href="https://repl.it/JE5T/1">greater less or equal to 10 function</a>.

Currently, alongside taking my Python course on CodeAcademy, I am working on building an English to Pig Latin translator that should be available soon!
That will combine my learning of strings, printing, various methods, and basic functions, plus some if/else statements. I'm excited about that.

Will keep you all updated!
