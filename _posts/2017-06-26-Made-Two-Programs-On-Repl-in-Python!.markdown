Hello Everyone!

So, I've been learning some basic Python programming.  I'm taking the Python Course through CodeAcademy.com currently, which is going well.  

Today, to implement some of what I've been learning about/in Python (programming language), I created two new programs on my REPL website. You can check out my main REPL page at <a href="repl.it/user/seangarvey.com">repl.it/user/seangarvey.com</a>

Anyway, the first program I made today asks for your name and for a description of your quest.  
Then it takes your raw input and responds to what you input with a reply! 
It also utilizes a print(ing) substitution technique. Pretty cool. :-)

My other program is a bit more advanced; I built a basic calendar program.  
It imports the datetime then uses that to calculate and provide a list of details including today's date, year, month, day, etc. 
I even through in two quotes, one from myself and another from an unknown source.  
It uses a lot of string concatenation plus advanced printing (substitution) techniques.  
I'm pretty proud of it, overall.
